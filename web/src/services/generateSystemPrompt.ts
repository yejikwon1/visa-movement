  * MM-DD-YYYY format: "04-01-2023" = April 1, 2023
  * "C" = Current (available immediately)
  * "U" = Unavailable
- "AllChargeabilityAreasExceptThoseListed" means "All other countries" or "Rest of World"
- For EB-3, use the "3rd" category under employment
- Parse ALL date strings carefully - do not interpret dates as "Current"
- Double-check every date before responding
